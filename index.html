            Millions of Americans suffer from pain and are often prescribed opioids to treat their conditions. 
            However, the dangers of prescription misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose have been a growing problem 
            throughout the United States.Drug Overdose remains a major concern in United States. In 2019, 70,630 drug 
            overdose deaths occurred in the United States. Opioids currently are the main driver of drug overdose deaths. 
            This includes prescription opioids, synthetic opioids and heroin.

            impacted the most by the opioid crisis/overdose deaths in the US during 2019?

            <strong>Narrative Structure</strong>
            The visualization follows an interactive slideshow that guides the user through various scenarios.
            First slide shows the region wise breakdown across the US for the average deaths due to drug overdose.
            The 2 slide shows the breakdown of the deaths across different states for each region
            and the third shows the top 5 states with highest deaths across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            The first page showcases the average deaths across the various regions showing 
            an overview of the Drug Overdose within the United States.The following charts show a state wise 
            breakdown of all states in the US and the Top 5 states with the highest deaths due to the overdose problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Chart 1 has an annotation that is meant to draw the user's attention to the area of the chart that highlights the 
            region impacted by the drug overdose problem.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Charts 2 and 3 include parameters (filters for state, region ) that allow users to interact with the data via filtering.
            The scenes aim to answer a simple question and these parameters allow users to explore data in more detail.
            For example, California, Texas, Florida and Northeast states seem to have much more drug overdose deaths than other states.  When a
            particular region is selected, the scene changes to show the data for the corresponding states in the region. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Triggers</strong>
            Choosing different filters on charts 2 and 3 triggers changes to the parameters discussed above and updates the 
            charts to reflect the changes and show the relevant information just pertaining to the filters selected..

            This chart shows that average IMDB scores have actually steadily declined over the past several years
            starting in 2016. So far, Netflix original films in 2021 have received the worst scores since 2014.
            Check/uncheck the checkboxes to see how scores have changed for a given set of genres.

            This chart ultimately answers the question of whether or not Netflix has gotten better at producing original
            films - on average, they haven't. That being said, it's difficult to see how all genres have scored for a given year.
            Next (and finally), let's take a look at average scores for each genre to provide even more insight into
            the data.

            This chart shows that Netflix excels at producing original films in the Animation, Crime, Documentary, and
            War genres. Check/uncheck the checkboxes to see how genres have scored for a given set of years.

            From the past 3 charts it's clear that although Netflix is producing more and more original films the quality
            of these films (according to IMDB) has declined over the past several years, but specific genres have clearly
            outperformed others.
