            <strong>Interactive Slideshow</strong>
            This narrative visualization follows an interactive slideshow structure to guide users through
            various selected scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            Three scenes have been included in this visualization using consistent template and layout. User's can
            navigate through the slideshow by clicking the arrows on the left/right sides of the screen, clicking the
            navigation dots on top, or using the left/right buttons on a keyboard.

          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Interesting trends are annotated in charts 1 and 2 using black font. These are meant to draw a user's attention
            to areas of the chart that are important to the overarching question behind the visualization.

          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Charts 2 and 3 include parameters that allow users to interact with the data via filtering. The scenes aim
            to answer a simple question and these parameters allow users to explore data in more detail.

            This chart shows that the number of Netflix originals has increased each year over the past several years.
            Note that the dataset includes originals up to June 1st, 2021, so although it looks like less originals were
            produced in 2021 the reality is that Netflix is on track to produce a similar number of originals to 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            This charts proves that Netflix is continuing to invest more and more in original films, but the
            questions still stands, have they improved film quality over time? Next, let's take a look at average IMDB
            scores for each year to move closer to an answer.

            This chart shows that average IMDB scores have actually steadily declined over the past several years
            starting in 2016. So far, Netflix original films in 2021 have received the worst scores since 2014.
            Check/uncheck the checkboxes to see how scores have changed for a given set of genres.

            This chart ultimately answers the question of whether or not Netflix has gotten better at producing original
            films - on average, they haven't. That being said, it's difficult to see how all genres have scored for a given year.
            Next (and finally), let's take a look at average scores for each genre to provide even more insight into
            the data.

            This chart shows that Netflix excels at producing original films in the Animation, Crime, Documentary, and
            War genres. Check/uncheck the checkboxes to see how genres have scored for a given set of years.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the past 3 charts it's clear that although Netflix is producing more and more original films the quality
            of these films (according to IMDB) has declined over the past several years, but specific genres have clearly
            outperformed others.
