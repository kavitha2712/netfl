            <strong>Narrative Structure</strong>
            The visualization follows an interactive slideshow that guides the user through various scenarios.
            First slide shows the region wise breakdown across the US for the average deaths due to drug overdose.
            The 2 slide shows the breakdown of the deaths across different states for each region
            and the third shows the top 5 states with highest deaths across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            The first page showcases the average deaths across the various regions showing 
            an overview of the Drug Overdose within the United States.The following charts show a state wise 
            breakdown of all states in the US and the Top 5 states with the highest deaths due to the overdose problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Chart 1 has an annotation that is meant to draw the user's attention to the area of the chart that highlights the 
            region impacted by the drug overdose problem.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Charts 2 and 3 include parameters (filters for state, region ) that allow users to interact with the data via filtering.
            The scenes aim to answer a simple question and these parameters allow users to explore data in more detail.
            For example, California, Texas, Florida and Northeast states seem to have much more drug overdose deaths than other states.  When a
            particular region is selected, the scene changes to show the data for the corresponding states in the region. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Triggers</strong>
            Choosing different filters on charts 2 and 3 triggers changes to the parameters discussed above and updates the 
            charts to reflect the changes and show the relevant information just pertaining to the filters selected..

            This chart shows the number of deaths across all the states in the US.

            Based on these 3 charts it's clear that drug overdose problem has affected almost all the states of the US. 
            This illustrates how legitimate clinical prescriptions of pain relievers are leading to misuse, addiction, and death.
            This is an epidemic that needs to be addressed to avoid raise in the overdose deaths.
